    - title: 3D Scene Understanding & Decomposing Using Open Vocabulary Texts
      institution: 'Supervisor: Prof. Shijian Lu, Nanyang Technological University'
      year: 2022-now
      description:
        - Presented a new method for extracting 3D objects from intricate real-world scenes using open-vocabulary texts.
        - Our approach transfers knowledge from a text2image diffusion model to 3D scenes with a generative loss.
        - Our method is capable of detecting and segmenting 3D objects in a zero-shot manner.
    
    - title: 3D Scene Appearance Editing through Style Transfer
      institution: 'Supervisor: Prof. Shijian Lu, Nanyang Technological University'
      year: 2022-now
      description:
        - Introduced an innovative framework that can generate zero-shot high-quality 3D stylization.
        - Resolved the three-way dilemma over geometry reconstruction, high-quality stylization, and zero-shot ability.
        - Designed novel algorithms to maintain multi-view consistency and improve stylization efficiency.
        - Our method delivers state-of-the-art 3D stylization results and can realize practical applications.

    - title: 2D Image Synthesis through Style Transfer
      institution: 'Supervisor: Prof. Lu Sheng, Beihang University'
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Developed a zero-shot 2D style transfer algorithm utilizing Transformer and Bilateral Grid.
        - Implemented a per-style-per-model style transfer algorithm using Transformer and Markovian discriminator.
        - Both methods attain visually state-of-the-art performance.
