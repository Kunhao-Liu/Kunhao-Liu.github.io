I am a first-year Ph.D. student at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), Singapore, specializing in 3D computer vision research under the guidance of [Professor Shijian Lu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/shijian.lu/). I received my Bachelor's degree from [Beihang University](https://ev.buaa.edu.cn/), Beijing, China, where I was supervised by [Professor Lu Sheng](https://lucassheng.github.io/). My research interests lie primarily in the areas of 3D scene understanding and editing.
